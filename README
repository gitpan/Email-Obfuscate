NAME
    Email::Obfuscate - Obfuscates email addresses

SYNOPSIS
      use Email::Obfuscate qw(obfuscate_email_address);

      print obfuscate_email_address('foo@bar.com'), "\n"; # foo[at]bar[dot]com

DESCRIPTION
    This package provides for the obfuscation of email address in an,
    ostensibly superficial, attempt to thwart email address harvesters.

    Currently, there are eight different "types" of email address
    obfuscation transformations that this module employs. One of these
    transformations is randomly selected and used as a basis for obfuscation
    when obfuscate_email_address() is called.
